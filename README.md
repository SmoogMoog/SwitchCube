# SwitchCube
 A 2D platformer Unity Game I made for an Intro to Game Programming class in 2019.
 All game assets, scripts, and level design are developed by me with the exception of the music. 
 The music is from "A Hat In Time" developed by Gears for Breakfast. 
 
 WASD - To move
 Spacebar - To Jump
 Shift - To swap your color
 
 Matching colors allow you to walk through objects.
 Contrasting colors makes you collide against objects.
 
 Get to the door at the end of the rooms, have fun!
