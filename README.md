# SwitchCube
 A 2D platformer Unity Game I made for an Intro to Game Programming class in 2019. Everything is done by me except the music, the music is from "A Hat In Time" developed by Gears for Breakfast. 
 
 WASD - To move
 Spacebar - To Jump
 Shift - To swap your color
 
 Get to the door at the end of the rooms, have fun!
